Dungeon Crawler Game
Introduction
This is a simple dungeon crawler game written in Python. The game generates a random dungeon with a specified number of rooms, and each room is randomly assigned to be a "Treasure Room", "Monster Room", "Puzzle Room", or "Empty Room". The treasure, monsters, and puzzles are also randomly chosen from predefined lists. The player can progress through the dungeon by inputting 'y' to move to the next room or 'n' to exit the game.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Launching the game
To launch the game, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the game is stored. Then, run the command:

Copy code
python dungeon_crawler.py
The game will start and you will see the welcome message.

Playing the game
The game will start in the first room of the dungeon. You will be prompted with the type of room you are in and any additional information such as treasure or monsters. You will then be prompted to choose to move to the next room or exit the game.

If you choose to move to the next room, you will be taken to the next room in the dungeon and prompted again with the room information.

If you choose to exit the game, the game will end and a message thanking you for playing will be displayed.

Exiting the game
You can exit the game at any point by typing 'n' when prompted to move to the next room. Once you exit the game, a message thanking you for playing will be displayed and the game will end.

Conclusion
This is a simple game that allows you to experience a randomly generated dungeon crawler. The game can be expanded to include more complex functionality such as adding a health system and combat mechanics for the monsters, or more complex puzzles and treasures. I hope you enjoy playing the game!
